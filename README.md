# Issue Tracker

**Issue Tracker** is a simple web app created using JavaScript only (No JavaScript framework is used). App is made to represent my skills with ES6 JavaScript. I have used bunch of arrow functions to add search issues, sort them according to different properties of issue.

On the index page, user can add issue description, severity level and assigned To property and can add issue. App saves all these issues in local storage. User can go to print page which has table of all issues and user can print this page with very minimal content on it. 

Webpack is used as a task manager of the project. Babel is used to compile ES6 code to vanilla JavaScript so that old browsers can understand the code. SASS is used as a pre processor for CSS.
